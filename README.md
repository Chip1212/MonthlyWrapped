Spotify Monthly Wrapped Project

I am using this project to learn to work with the spotify web api and generally to improve my javascript skills. 
The application essentially uses the spotify provided authorization code and then, when prompted with a button push, creates a new playlist
in the user's account containing that user's top 20 tracks from the past month. The idea was inspired by the end of year Wrapped materials
that spotify releases.
